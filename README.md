# Blazor.AppIdeas
Sample applications from app-ideas written in Blazor and .NET 5.

There are a great set of [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) posted by Florin Pop that are great for learning new technologies. I will be implementing those app ideas using Blazor as the client-side SPA technology targeting on .NET 5. Blazor allows developers to build client-side applications with C# and their favorites .NET Core and .NET 5 libraries. Hopefully these samples will help accelerate our learning.
